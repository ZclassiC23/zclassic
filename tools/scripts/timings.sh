# timings.sh — `make timings`. Reports where the wall time goes on THIS host,
# by reading the artifacts the tools already write. It measures nothing itself
# and it never carries a number forward from another machine or another commit.
#
# Sources (all machine-written, all gitignored):
#   .cache/lint-timing/last-run.json      written by tools/lint/run_lint.sh
#   .cache/test-timing/last-run.json      written by the parallel test runner
#   .cache/zcl-dev-loop/bench-latest.json written by tools/dev/dev-loop-bench.sh
#   .cache/first-build-timing/last-run.json  written by
#                                         tools/scripts/first_build_timing.sh
#
# Four honesty rules, each of which exists because the failure it prevents is
# on disk right now:
#
#   NOT MEASURED  the artifact is absent. Print that, never a borrowed number.
#                 A fresh clone or a fresh worktree has no .cache at all, and a
#                 plausible-looking duration from somebody else's laptop is
#                 worse than no duration.
#   STALE         the artifact predates HEAD. The code moved after the
#                 measurement, so the measurement describes different code.
#   UNTRUSTED     the artifact recorded its own command as a shell no-op
#                 (":", "true", empty). Five of the six dev-loop bench cases
#                 are in exactly that state: they "passed" in ~3 ms because
#                 they ran `:`. Quoting 3 ms as a build time would be a lie the
#                 artifact itself tells. The reader refuses to repeat it.
#                 (The bench script is not the bug — it emits a real command
#                 for the case that has one. The reader is what needed fixing.)
#   FAILED        a recorded stage exited nonzero. Its duration is real but it
#                 is not the cost of a build that works, so the total is
#                 withheld and the stage is named instead.
#   PARTIAL       the run covered fewer units than the current suite defines,
#                 e.g. a lint artifact from a fast-subset run. The wall time is
#                 real but it is not the wall time of the full gate.
#
# Read-only. Writes nothing, measures nothing, never fails a build.
