# Lint gate E11 — the documented lint-gate set matches the Makefile (HARD).
#
# Doc rot is silent: the Makefile LINT_GATES target gains/loses a check-* gate
# and DEFENSIVE_CODING.md still claims the old count and names. This gate
# cross-checks the two sources of truth so the doc can never drift from
# the build.
#
# Source of truth A: the LINT_GATES variable in Makefile (the umbrella gate
#   list; historically the literal check-* prerequisites of the `lint:`
#   target, which remains the fallback when LINT_GATES is absent).
# Source of truth B: a machine-readable canonical block in
#   DEFENSIVE_CODING.md delimited by the markers
#     <!-- LINT-GATES-BEGIN --> ... <!-- LINT-GATES-END -->
#   containing one `check-*` token per documented gate (any surrounding
#   markdown is ignored; we extract the check-* tokens).
#
# The gate fails if the COUNT differs or the NAME SET differs. To fix a
# real drift: update the doc block (markers) to match the Makefile — never
# the other way around (the Makefile is authoritative for what runs).
#
# Prong C (repo-wide, added after a measured escape): checking one filename
# only protects one filename. On 2026-07-25 the Makefile carried 98 gates and
# DEFENSIVE_CODING.md correctly said 98, so prongs A/B were green — while
# docs/BUILD.md said "40 defensive-coding gates" and docs/TENACITY.md said
# "36 lint gates". Both had been wrong for months with lint green, because
# neither file was named in this script. Prong C therefore does NOT name
# files: it derives the count from the Makefile (source A) and then scans
# EVERY in-tree *.md (tracked, plus not-yet-added files git does not ignore)
# for a count-shaped claim about the umbrella gate set.
# Writing the stale claim into a brand-new file is caught the same way, and
# the gate stays correct when the gate count changes because nothing here is
# hardcoded to a number.
#
# What prong C considers a claim about the umbrella set (deliberately narrow
# so it can be strict rather than advisory): a number immediately followed by
# a FAMILY NAME for the whole set — "lint gates", "defensive-coding gates",
# "defensive-coding lint gates". Anything between the number and "gates" that
# is not a family word makes it a SUBSET claim and is ignored, which is what
# keeps true statements like "11 architecture gates", "7 fail-silent lint
# gates" and "~15 high-signal lint gates" from being false positives. The
# number must also start on a non-alphanumeric boundary, so identifier runs
# like "the P1/P2/P3 lint gates" and "I1/I2 lint gates" do not read as "3
# lint gates" / "2 lint gates".
#
# A matched claim must equal the derived count EXACTLY — including the "98+"
# form. The intended fix for a failure is not to re-pin a fresh number (that
# buys one week); it is to delete the number and point at the derived source.
