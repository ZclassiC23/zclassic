# binary_size.sh — the DERIVED source of truth for "how big is the binary".
#
# Dev-UX counterpart to the check-no-stale-pinned-facts lint gate. That gate
# forbids hand-pinning a "<N> MB binary" claim in the docs (a stale "~15 MB"
# survived long after the real binary grew past 20 MB). The sovereign-doctrine
# fix is DERIVE-OR-GATE: instead of pinning a number, a doc author (or agent)
# runs THIS and quotes the live value, and a reviewer re-runs it to confirm.
#
# DESIGN DECISION (step 2 of the anti-stale lane): the binary size is NOT baked
# into the machine-checked DOC-COUNTS block in docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md. That block
# is build-free by contract (check_doc_counts.sh is "filesystem + grep only, no
# build"), whereas a binary size only exists after a whole-program LTO link and
# depends on the flag profile (release vs test, portable vs ZCL_NATIVE, Tor stub
# vs real libtor). Pinning it into a build-free doc gate would either break that
# contract or flake. So the answer is: forbid hand-pinned sizes (the gate) +
# size-agnostic prose ("compact self-contained C23 binary") + this on-demand
# derived helper for anyone who genuinely needs the current number.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/scripts/binary_size.sh            # human line for the default binary
#   tools/scripts/binary_size.sh --bytes    # just the byte count (scriptable)
#   tools/scripts/binary_size.sh path/to/bin
#
# Exit 0 with the size when the artifact exists; exit 1 (to stderr) when it has
# not been built yet — so callers can distinguish "unbuilt" from a real size.
